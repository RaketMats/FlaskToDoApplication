This is a competence project building a simple todo-app in Flask.

Inspiration comes from both the FlaskMegaTutorial and the 'flaskPythonSpot'-competence project, see documentation in these projects for further details.

The main areas to cover are:
- Flask
- Bootstrap for GUI
- JQuery for Ajax etc. functionality

Start via:
- 'venv\Scripts\activate.ps1'
- 'python app.py'
- '127.0.0.1:5000\Test2'
  - The original page, '127.0.0.1:5000\ToDoPage' does not work by some reason

There are then some mechanism for entering a todo, showing etc. via JSon objects.
